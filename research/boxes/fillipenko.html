									<h1>Hot Jupiters</h1>
											<p>Most of my time within the Filippenko Lab, I have worked on detecting orbital decay of Hot Jupiter systems. 
												As the name suggests, these exoplanets that roughly the massive of one Jupiter which orbits around its host approximately one day.
												Due to tidal forces, instead of a spherical shape, it disorts the expplanet to a shape of an egg. 
												There exists a bump on the surface of the star.
												However, the bump on the star does not align with the planet, it lags behind a little bit.
												This has interesting consquences for this system.

									<p>
										Essentally, this lag causes the bump to tug back on the planet, making it lose some of its angular momentumt and transfering back to the host star.
										The efficienct of this energy transfer is called the "tidal orbital factor" (<span class="mathjax">\(Q_{\star}'\)</span>).
										This is a measurement of how well the star and the planet are converting their energy into heat due to the tidal effects.
										It is hard to calculate this value since it requires a solid fundation of the theory of tides- which is a poorly developed.

									<p> <b>COMING SOON:</b> <br>
										In the near future, I write about our findings. 
										I will also share my talk, poster, data, and paper! Raw fits files can be requested through my email.</p>
										<p>I have to say thank you to my mentor, <a href="https://kcpatra45.github.io/">Kishore C. Patra</a>, for incredible guidance throughout this project!</p>

									<h1>Supernovae</h1>
									<p>
										When I was not looking at exoplanets, I also looked at supernovae. 
										I was an observer for the 1-m Nickel Telescope located at Lick Observatory (on Mt. Hamilton in sunny California).
										I was took direct images of the supernovae which photometry was preformed on the data I collected.
										Overall, this was an enjoyable experience for me as I have over 10 observation runs. 
										Though my work was not significant enough, it did help lead to a <a href='https://browse.arxiv.org/pdf/2302.00274.pdf'>publication</a> (see the acknowledgments section). 
										To me, this is cool since I played a small role that helps humankind's understanding of the universe around us - very corny, I apologize.
									</p>
									<div class="image-container" style="text-align: center; clear: both;">

										Here is me and my P.I., Prof. Alex Filippenko, at graduation. Unfortunately, this is not a great picture of me but it will have to do!

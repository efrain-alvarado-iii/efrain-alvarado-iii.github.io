										One of the perks of being a <a href="https://ucleads.ucop.edu/">UC LEADS</a> scholar is the opportunity to conduct research at any of the other nine UCs during the second summer of the program. 
										And yes, this includes UC San Francisco for anyone interested in medicine or related fields. 
										(I know that UCSF is just a grad school, so it came as a shock to me that you can still do research there as an undergrad.
										In hindsight, it makes sense. There is nothing that says you can't have undergrads helping to conduct research there.
										I guess it's a hidden curriculum thing.)
										I thought going to San Diego would be a nice change of scenery since I had lived in Northern California my whole life. 
										It turned out to be a good call since San Diego has been one the best places I've visited - with beautiful weather, fantastic food, and lovely beaches. 
										Can't beat that!

										At UC San Diego, I worked in the <a href="https://www.coolstarlab.org/">Cool Star Lab</a>, led by Prof. Adam J. Burgasser and mentored by Dr. Roman Gerasimov.
										The goal of my project was to generate evolutionary and atmospheric models for Ultracool Subdwarfs (UCDs).
										These objects have masses that do not exceed 10% of the Sun’s mass (<span class="mathjax">\(\mathrm{M} \leq 0.1~\mathrm{M_{\odot}}\)</span>)
										and reach effective temperatures below <span class="mathjax">\(3000~\mathrm{K}\)</span> (<span class="mathjax">\(T_{\mathrm{eff}} \leq 3000~\mathrm{K}\)</span>).
										The brown dwarfs among UCDs, which occupy the lowest-mass regime, possess numerous unique properties.
										One such property is their exceptionally long lifespans, which can exceed the current age of the universe.
										In other words, every UCD that has ever formed still exists today.
										Additionally, because they cannot sustain stable nuclear fusion, they cool continuously over time.
										This allows them to retain their original chemical compositions.
										Furthermore, their spectra are sensitive to chemical abundances.
										Taken together, these characteristics make UCDs prime targets for studying the history of the Milky Way, particularly how its metal content has changed over cosmic time.
										Motivated by this, my work focuses on providing new atmospheric models capable of capturing metal-poor compositions across a range of effective temperatures,
										as well as evolutionary models that describe how these objects change over time.
									</p>
									<p>
										So, the way we generate these models begins with the fact that the fewest parameters needed to describe a star are its age, mass, and chemical composition.
										As mentioned earlier, the chemical composition of UCDs does not change significantly over their lifetimes—technically it does, but the effect is negligible—
										so throughout this process we keep that value fixed.
										From a bird’s-eye view, we start with these parameters and input them into
										<a href="https://docs.mesastar.org/en/release-r23.05.1/">Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (<span class="mathjax">\( \texttt{MESA} \)</span>)</a>,
										which outputs the effective temperature (<span class="mathjax">\(T_\mathrm{eff}\)</span>) and surface gravity (<span class="mathjax">\( \mathrm{log}(g) \)</span>)—
										and technically the chemical composition as well, though this is kept fixed as noted above.
										Using the results from MESA, we then generate atmospheric models with the proprietary
										<a href="https://www.physik.uni-hamburg.de/en/hs/group---hauschildt.html#:~:text=PHOENIX%20Code,-What%20is%20PHOENIX&text=PHOENIX%20is%20a%20general%2Dpurpose,all%20across%20the%20HR%2Ddiagram."><span class="mathjax">\( \texttt{PHOENIX} \)</span></a> code.

											<p>
												This figure illustrates the general workflow used to obtain evolutionary models and synthetic spectra for these objects.
											</p>
										</div>
										However, we begin by generating the atmospheric models first, as this is the most computationally intensive part of the project.
									</p>
									<p> 
										We focus on a subset of metals when generating atmospheric models,
										namely elements produced through the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_process">alpha process</a>:
										<span class="mathjax">\( \mathrm{[O,~Ne,~Mg,~Si,~S,~Ar,~Ca,\&~Ti]}\)</span>.
										The abundance of these elements relative to iron is referred to as alpha enrichment,
										denoted by <span class="mathjax">\( \mathrm{[\alpha/Fe]}\)</span>.
										We focus on these elements because they serve as powerful chemical tracers.
										Alpha elements are primarily produced during the lifetimes and deaths of massive stars;
										in the early universe, stars were generally more massive than those commonly observed today.
										As a result, the alpha enrichment of a brown dwarf encodes information about the chemical history of the stellar populations that existed before it formed.
									</p>
									<p>	
										We used the <span class="mathjax">\( \mathrm{[Fe/H]}\)</span>–<span class="mathjax">\( \mathrm{[\alpha/Fe]}\)</span> distribution of Milky Way stars derived from APOGEE spectra to generate a chemical grid (see figure below).
										Specifically, we constructed a grid of 24 different combinations of <span class="mathjax">\( \mathrm{[Fe/H]}\)</span> and <span class="mathjax">\( \mathrm{[\alpha/Fe]}\)</span>,
										sampling stellar populations from the Milky Way’s thin disk, thick disk, and halo,
										as well as metal-poor, alpha-enhanced abundances commonly observed in globular clusters.

											<p>
												This figure shows the chemical distribution of stars in the <span class="mathjax">\( \mathrm{[Fe/H]}\)</span>–<span class="mathjax">\( \mathrm{[\alpha/Fe]}\)</span> phase plane.
												In this case, <span class="mathjax">\(\mathrm{Mg}\)</span> is used as an indicator of alpha enrichment.
												The figure also illustrates where stars of specific chemical compositions are typically found within the Milky Way.
												Metal-poor, highly alpha-enriched stars tend to occupy more elliptical orbits, characteristic of the halo and thick disk.
												This plot is taken from <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019MNRAS.482.3426M/abstract">Mackereth et al. (2019)</a>.

										</div>
									</p>
									<p>
										We computed a grid—called the Spectral ANalog of Dwarfs (<span class="mathjax">\( \texttt{SAND} \)</span>) grid—
										consisting of 24 different chemical compositions spanning metallicity and alpha enrichment.
										The grid covers effective temperatures <span class="mathjax">\(T_\mathrm{eff}\)</span> ranging from <span class="mathjax">\(4000~\mathrm{K}\)</span> down to <span class="mathjax">\(700~\mathrm{K}\)</span> in steps of <span class="mathjax">\(100~\mathrm{K}\)</span>,
										surface gravities <span class="mathjax">\( \mathrm{log}(g) \)</span> from 4.0 to 6.0 in steps of 0.5 dex,
										and <span class="mathjax">\( \mathrm{[Fe/H]} \)</span> values (solar-scaled, with variable step size).
										All atmospheric models were computed using <a href="https://www.psc.edu/resources/bridges-2/">Bridges-2</a> in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
										With all calculations complete, the final results are shown in the figure below.
										More details about the <span class="mathjax">\( \texttt{SAND} \)</span> grid can be found in the research note at the bottom of the website.

										Using the <span class="mathjax">\( \texttt{SAND} \)</span> grid, which provides temperature–pressure profiles,
										we can use these models as boundary conditions for solving the stellar structure equations with <span class="mathjax">\( \texttt{MESA} \)</span>.
										From the 24 chemical compositions, we generated a set of isochrone tracks, which we refer to as
										<span class="mathjax">\( \texttt{SANDee} \)</span> (<b>e</b>volutionary <b>e</b>xtension to <span class="mathjax">\( \texttt{SAND} \)</span>).
									</p>
									<p>
										Now, with the launch of the James Webb Space Telescope, Euclid operational, and both the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope
										and the Vera C. Rubin Observatory underway, the next step is to identify and characterize more UCDs.
										These observatories will be sensitive enough to detect such objects across a wide range of environments.
										By discovering and analyzing larger samples of UCDs, we can place stronger constraints on their properties
										and ultimately gain deeper insight into the formation and evolutionary history of the Milky Way.

								<p> As Professor Raffaella Margutti said, "All astrophysical phenomena are beautiful."
									I truly love learning anything that relates to astrophysics. 
									Unfortunately, we all have to choose something to focus on. 
									Currently, I am interested in studying the atmospheres of low-mass stars, brown dwarfs, and exoplanets. 
									My work mostly focuses more on the theortical, computational side of things.

									Hello, my name is Efrain Alvarado III. 
									I am a first-generation Hispanic student, and my academic journey has not been linear. 
									I began my studies at San Francisco State University in 2017 but left due to the high cost of living. 
									The following year, I enrolled at Sacramento City College, where I completed my general education and breadth requirements in 2021.
									I then went on to earn my Bachelor’s degree in Astrophysics from UC Berkeley (Go Bears!) in the summer of 2023. 
									I am now fortunate to continue pursuing my passion at San Francisco State University, where I am currently earning a Master of Science in Astronomy and Astrophysics. 
									Looking ahead, my goal is to earn a Ph.D. at a university with the overarching goal that I might a professor.

									The common trope for why people get into astronomy is because of stargazing.
									But for me, this is true, with a very specific memory.
									I was fortunate to know from a very young age that I wanted to be an astronomer.
									It was all thanks to my uncle, who used to talk to me about the stars and planets, which always captivated me.
									The pivotal moment for me was looking through a telescope and seeing Jupiter and its moons.
									It was then that I realized this is what Galileo might have seen in 1610.
									Now, I am on a quest to fulfill that childhood dream and contribute to humanity’s understanding of the universe.

								</p>
								<p>
									Stay tuned. I might add another link where I put all my hobbies and pictures there. 
									Probably something like a blog?
									We'll see.

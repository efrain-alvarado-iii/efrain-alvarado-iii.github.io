										This has been a really exciting project for me, as it is complementary to my undergraduate work at <a href="../boxes/UCDs.html">UC San Diego</a>.
										I recommend reading about that project first before continuing with this section.
										Most of this work will be included in my Master’s thesis.
										At a later time, I will link my thesis along with my defense talk.
										We also anticipate an additional publication resulting from this work.
										As a note, this is an ongoing project involving proprietary data, so I am unable to show many results at this time.
										However, I can explain the background and motivation behind the project.
									</p>
									<p>
										To begin, it is helpful to introduce who I am working with.
										I work with Dr. Gonzales at San Francisco State University, along with another graduate student in the Substellar InvestiGATOR Group<sup id="ref-1"><a href="#note-1">[1]</a></sup>, Ember Vosmek-Park.
										Dr. Gonzales’s research primarily focuses on determining fundamental parameters and atmospheric properties of brown dwarfs,
										with particular expertise in subdwarfs.
										She does this using atmospheric retrieval techniques, implemented through a code called <em>Brewster</em><sup id="ref-2"><a href="#note-2">[2]</a></sup>.
									</p>
									<p>
										Before explaining what an atmospheric retrieval is, it is useful to first discuss forward models.
										During my time at UC San Diego, I helped create the <span class="mathjax">\( \texttt{SAND} \)</span> grid—these are examples of forward models.
										In brief, forward modeling involves incorporating as much physics and chemistry as possible into a model,
										while varying only a limited set of parameters
										(e.g., <span class="mathjax">\( T_\mathrm{eff} \)</span>, <span class="mathjax">\( \mathrm{log}(g) \)</span>, <span class="mathjax">\( \mathrm{[Fe/H]} \)</span>, etc.).
										This approach is strongly grounded in physical theory, but it also has important limitations.
									</p>
									<p>
										Modeling the atmospheres of metal-poor brown dwarfs (subdwarfs) is particularly challenging,
										as most empirical knowledge of brown dwarfs comes from nearby, solar-metallicity field dwarfs.
										Because of this bias, forward models often struggle to reproduce certain features observed in subdwarf spectra.
										An alternative approach is to introduce more free parameters while assuming less detailed physics
										(e.g., different parameterizations of the thermal structure, turning clouds on or off, or varying cloud properties).
										This approach is known as atmospheric retrieval.
										While we must be cautious—since simplifying the physics can introduce degeneracies—retrievals are extremely valuable when compared against forward models.
										Such comparisons allow us to identify where forward models break down and guide future improvements.
									</p>
									<p>
										In this project, I am using data from the Arcana of the Ancients James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) program <a href="">GO #4668</a>.
										JWST is critical for this work because it provides the infrared sensitivity required to obtain high signal-to-noise spectra
										of these intrinsically faint and cold brown dwarfs.
										Additionally, JWST enables much broader wavelength coverage.
										Most existing data span approximately <span class="mathjax">\( \sim 0.6–2.5~\mu \mathrm{m} \)</span>;
										with JWST, we extend this coverage to <span class="mathjax">\( \sim 0.6–14~\mu \mathrm{m} \)</span>.
										Our sample consists of L and T dwarfs spanning known temperatures (spectral types) and metallicities (metallicity classes),
										with emphasis on the brightest sources and those with Gaia and/or ground-based astrometry.
										One of the primary goals of this program is to improve atmospheric modeling of low-temperature subdwarf spectra
										and to better understand how metallicity influences condensation processes in cool atmospheres.
									</p>
									<p>
										One of the key targets in this program is J14162408+1348263AB (J1416AB),
										the only known subdwarf L+T binary system.
										My project partner, Ember, focuses on J1416A (the L dwarf), while I focus on J1416B (the T dwarf).
										In 2017, Mike Line performed the first atmospheric retrieval on this system.
										In 2020, my advisor conducted another retrieval using the <em>Brewster</em> framework.
										In 2022, Joseph Zalesky carried out an additional retrieval with modifications relative to Line’s original work.
										The novelty of my project lies in performing retrievals using JWST data,
										combining NIRSpec/PRISM with MIRI/LRS and NIRSpec/G395H—all instruments aboard JWST.
									</p>
									<p>
										The next step is to apply the <em>Brewster</em> framework to the JWST data and directly compare the results with previous studies.
										In parallel, we also aim to perform spectral fitting using forward models with the same data set,
										providing a direct comparison between retrieval-based and physics-driven modeling approaches.

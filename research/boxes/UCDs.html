										One of the perks of being a <a href="https://ucleads.ucop.edu/">UC LEADS</a> scholar is the opportunity to conduct research at any of the other nine UCs during the second summer of the program. 
										And yes, this includes UC San Francisco for anyone interested in medicine or related fields. 
										(I know that UCSF is just a grad school, so it came as a shock to me that you can still do research there as an undergrad.
										In hindsight, it makes sense. There is nothing that says you can't have undergrads helping to conduct research there.
										I guess it's a hidden curriculum thing.)
										I thought going to San Diego would be a nice change of scenery since I had lived in Northern California my whole life. 
										It turned out to be a good call since San Diego has been one the best places I've visited - with beautiful weather, fantastic food, and lovely beaches. 
										Can't beat that!

									<p> At UC San Diego, I worked in the <a href="https://www.coolstarlab.org/">Cool Star Lab</a>, led by Prof. Adam J. Burgasser and mentored by Dr. Roman Gerasimov.
										The goal of my project was to generate evolutionary and atmospheric models for Ultracool Subdwarfs (UCDs).
										These objects have masses that do no exceed 10% of the sun's mass (<span class="mathjax">\(\mathrm{M} \leq 0.1 \mathrm{M_{\odot}}\)</span>),
										and reach effective temperatures of less than <span class="mathjax">\(3000~\mathrm{K}\)</span>  (<span class="mathjax">\(T_{\mathrm{eff}} \leq 3000~\mathrm{K}\)</span>).
										The brown dwarfs among UCDs, the lowest in mass, have numerious of unique properities.
										One of which is they have long lifespans which can exceed the current age of the universe.  
										In other words, every UCD that has formed still exists today.
										Another is the fact that they cool over time since they cannot sustain nuclear fusion.
										This means that they can retain their chemical composition.
										Furthermore, their spectra are senstive to chemical abundances.
										There are diverse range of metalicity of these objects, including metal-poor.
										Putting these facts together, these objects are prime targets to study the history of the Milky Way, seeing how the metal content has change throughout its lifetime.
										So, this is the motivation for the work: providing new atmospheric models that are able to capture the metal-poor contents and various effective temperature.
										And being able to provide evolutionary models of these objects and seeing how they could change over time.
									</p>

									<p>
										So, how we go about generating these models is that the fewest numbers you need to describe a star is its age, mass, and chemical composition.
										As mentioned earlier, UCDs' chemical composition does not change over its lifetime -techincally it does but it's negilible- 
										so throughout this processes we will keep that value fixed.
										From a bird's eye view, we ideally start with these numbers and plug them into <a href="https://docs.mesastar.org/en/release-r23.05.1/"> Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (<span class="mathjax">\( \texttt{MESA} \)</span>)</a>,
										which gives us <span class="mathjax">\(T_\mathrm{{eff}}\)</span> and surface gravity (<span class="mathjax">\( \mathrm{log}(g)\)</span>)-techincally chemical composition as well, but as mentioned earlier, we keep this fixed.
										From the results of MESA, we can generate atmospheric models using the propietary
										<a href="https://www.physik.uni-hamburg.de/en/hs/group---hauschildt.html#:~:text=PHOENIX%20Code,-What%20is%20PHOENIX&text=PHOENIX%20is%20a%20general%2Dpurpose,all%20across%20the%20HR%2Ddiagram." ><span class="mathjax">\( \texttt{PHOENIX} \)</span></a> code
									<div class="image-container" style="text-align: center; clear: both;">
										<img src="../images/process.png"  style="width: 60%; height: auto;" alt="">
									   <p>
									   This is the general idea how we obtain evolutionary models and synthetic spectrum of these objects.
									   </p>
							   		</div>
										But, we start at generating the atmospheric models since this the most computationally heavy part of this project.
									</p>

									<p> 
										We focus on a subset of metals when generating atmospheric models,
										mamely, elements from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_process"> alpha-process</a>- <span class="mathjax">\( \mathrm{[O,~Ne,~Mg,~Si,~S,~Ar,~Ca,\&~Ti]}\)</span>.
										The amount of these elements is refered to alpha-enrichment [<span class="mathjax">\( \mathrm{[\alpha/Fe]}\)</span>].
										And the reason why focus on them as we use them as chemical tracers
										since these elements are created through the lifetime of the creation and distruction of massive-stars- the first stars of the universe are more massive than the ones we see today.
										This informs us the chemical history of the pervious stars before the brown dwarf that we see today.
									<p>	
										We used <span class="mathjax">\( \mathrm{[Fe/H]}\)</span>-<span class="mathjax">\( \mathrm{[\alpha/Fe]}\)</span> distribution of Milky Way stars from APOGEE spectra to generate chemical grid (see figure below).
										We generated a grid of 24 different combinations of <span class="mathjax">\( \mathrm{[Fe/H]}\)</span> and <span class="mathjax">\( \mathrm{[\alpha/Fe]}\)</span>,
										which samples from the Milky Way's thin disk, thick disk, and halo as well as metal-poor <span class="mathjax">\ \alpha </span>-enhanced abundances observed in globular clusters
										<div class="image-container" style="text-align: center; clear: both;">
										<img src="../images/Mackereth.jpg"  style="width: 75%; height: 75%;" alt="">
										<p>
											This is the chemical distribution of stars in the <span class="mathjax">\( \mathrm{[Fe/H]}\)</span>-<span class="mathjax">\( \mathrm{[\alpha/Fe]}\)</span> phase plane.
											In this case, <span class="mathjax">\(\mathrm{Mg}\)</span> is an indicator of alpha-enchriment.
											It also shows where you can typically find stars of specific chemical composition within the Milky Way.
											Metal-poor, high alpha-enriched stars tend to be found in higher ellipical orbits -the halo and the disk. 
											This plot was gathered from the <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019MNRAS.482.3426M/abstract">2019 Mackereth</a> paper.
										</p>
										</div>
									</p>

									<p>
										We computed a grid- called The Spectral ANalog of Dwarfs <span class="mathjax">\( \texttt{SAND} \)</span> grid- with the 24 chemistries of metalicity and alpha-enchriment with
										<span class="mathjax">\(T_\mathrm{{eff}}\)</span> ranging from <span class="mathjax">\(4000~\mathrm{K}\)</span> to <span class="mathjax">\(700~\mathrm{K}\)</span> in steps of <span class="mathjax">\(100~\mathrm{K}\)</span>, 
										<span class="mathjax">\( \mathrm{log}(g)\)</span> from 4.0 to 6.0 in steps of 0.5 dex,
										and <span class="mathjax">\( \mathrm{[Fe/H]}\)</span> (solar scaled, variable step size).
										All the atmospheric models were calculated using <a href="https://www.psc.edu/resources/bridges-2/">Bridges-2</a> in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
										With all said and done, here are the final results as shown in the figure below. You can find more about the <span class="mathjax">\( \texttt{SAND} \)</span> in the research note at the bottom of the website.

										Using the <span class="mathjax">\( \texttt{SAND} \)</span> grid, which contains tempereture profiles, 
										we can use them as boundary conditions for stellar strucutre equations using <span class="mathjax">\( \texttt{MESA} \)</span>.
										From the 24 chemistries, we generated isochrone tracks, which we refer to as <span class="mathjax">\( \texttt{SANDee} \)</span> (<b>e</b>volutionary <b>e</b>xtention to <span class="mathjax">\( \texttt{SAND} \)</span>).

										Now, with the launch of the James Webb Space Telescope, Euclid operational, and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope 
										and the Vera Rubin Observatory both underway, the job is now to go out and find more UCDs.
										These observatories will be senstive enough to find these objects (i.e. example, example, example,).
										By finding more UCDs, we might be able to study the evolution of the Milky Way.

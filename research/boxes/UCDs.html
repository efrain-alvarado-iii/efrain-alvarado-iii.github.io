									<p> One of the perks of being a <a href="https://ucleads.ucop.edu/">UC LEADS</a> scholar is that the second summer of the program, you get to chose any of other nine UCs to do research at.
										I thought going to San Diego would be a nice change from living in the Bay Area for most of my life. 
										San Diego has been one of the best places that I been to.
										Beautiful weather, great food, and nice beaches. Can't beat that!

									<p> I decieded to work at the <a href="https://www.coolstarlab.org/">Cool Star Lab</a> under Prof. Adam J. Burgasser.
										I was asigned to a project where I generatec evolutionary and atmospheric models of Ultracool Subdwarfs (UCDs).
										Essentially, UCDs are metal-pool low-mass stars and brown dwards with surface temperatures (<span class="mathjax">\(T_{eff}\)</span>) below 3000 K.
										The mass of these objects do no exceed 10% of the mass of the sun.
										Since these objects have these unique properties, the metalicitiy, chemical composition, does not change throughout their lifetime, and just cool over time.
										It is because of this, it allows us to provide a unique insight to study the evolution of the Milky Way.
									</p>
									<p> 
										So far, we have a fairly great understanding of generating stars that have similar chemical composition to that of the sun.
										In reality, stars will range with different chemical compositions.
										This is one of the motivations for this project.
										We want to generate atmospheric models of the UCDs.
										There are current models that exist, however these models do not fit well with observational data.
										This is partly to blame for the fact there are only on the order of hundreds know UCDs. 
										Basically, by providing these models, we will have a better understanding of they would look like.
									</p>
									<p>
										Before I continue on how we go about gerating these models. The fewest numbers you need to describe a star is its age, mass, and chemical composition.
										As mentioned earlier, UCDs' chemical composition does not change over its lifetime -techincally it does but its negilible- so throughout this processes we will keep that value fixed.
										With these numbers, we plug them into <a href="https://docs.mesastar.org/en/release-r23.05.1/"> Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA)</a> which gives us <span class="mathjax">\(T_{eff}\)</span> and surface gravity (<span class="mathjax">\(log(g)\)</span>)-techincally chemical composition as well, but as mentioned earlier, we keep this fixed.
										From the results of MESA, we use <span class="mathjax">\(T_{eff}\)</span> , <span class="mathjax">\(log(g)\)</span>, and chemical composition to generate atmospheric models using <a href="https://www.physik.uni-hamburg.de/en/hs/group---hauschildt.html#:~:text=PHOENIX%20Code,-What%20is%20PHOENIX&text=PHOENIX%20is%20a%20general%2Dpurpose,all%20across%20the%20HR%2Ddiagram." >PHOENIX</a> code
										This allows us to generate spectrum which astronomers can use. 
									<div class="image-container" style="text-align: center; clear: both;">
										<img src="../images/process.png"  style="width: 60%; height: auto;" alt="">
									   <p>
									   This is the general idea how we obtain spectrum of these objects. 
									   </p>
							   		</div>
									</p>
									<p>
										We started with generating atmospheric models since this is the most computationally heavy part of this project.
										All the atmospheric models were calculated using <a href="https://www.psc.edu/resources/bridges-2/">Bridges-2</a> in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
										Then all the evolutionary models were computed on local devices.
									
									</p>
									<p>
										Now, with the launch of the James Webb Space Telescope, Euclid operational, the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, 
										and the Vera Rubin Observatory bother underway, the job is to go out and find UCDs.
										These observatories will be senstive enough to find these objects.
										By finding more UCDs, we might be able to study the evolution of the Milky Way. 
									</p>
									<p>
										I want to give a special thank you to <a href="https://romanger.com/">Dr. Roman Gerasimov</a>  for the mentorship of this project!
										Also, on a side note, I will share the slides to my talk and the research note (in prep) at a later time.
